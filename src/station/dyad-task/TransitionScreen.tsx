// The screen that announces whose feelings the next block is about.
//
// Randy, 2026-07-30: participants were missing the perspective switch, and a
// participant who is bored of the study will press through an announcement
// screen without reading it. So this screen holds itself open: keys do nothing
// for the first few seconds, and the remaining time is shown so the wait reads
// as deliberate rather than as a frozen app.
//
// The dwell is a data-quality control, not decoration — a block rated from the
// wrong perspective is unusable, and there is no way to detect it after the
// fact.
//
// Randy, 2026-08-05: same wait screen everywhere, and three seconds rather than
// six. The wording and the countdown now come from PerspectiveNotice, which the
// video task uses for exactly the same announcement between its own two
// perspectives — one component so the two tasks cannot drift apart.
