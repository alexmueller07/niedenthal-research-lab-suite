// The continuous valence slider.
//
// MEASUREMENT — do not change without talking to Randy. The recorded value is
// the pointer's position along the visible track, 0 at the left end to 100 at
// the right (clamped), pushed into the parent's ref on every mouse move and
// sampled there every 100 ms. Still a 0-100 float in ratings.csv.
//
// Alex, 2026-08-10 — two changes from the pilot implementation, both flagged
// for Randy's sign-off in this commit:
//   - Geometry. The value was `clientX / window width`, but the track is inset
//     ~40px by the parent's px-10, so the handle and the anchor labels sat up
//     to ~40px off the pointer, and "Very Negative"/"Very Positive" hung over
//     values ≈4 and ≈96 rather than 0 and 100. The value is now measured
//     against the track element itself, so pointer, handle, labels and the
//     recorded number all refer to the same axis.
//   - Cadence. This component used to deposit the value on its own 100 ms
//     interval while DyadTaskMain sampled on another — two free-running
//     clocks, adding 0-100 ms of random staleness to every sample. The parent
//     ref is now updated directly from the mousemove handler (one ref write
//     per event) and the parent's loop is the only clock.
//
// Layout (Randy, 2026-07-30: "the words on the slider still aren't centered").
// The track spans the same width as the labels above it, so the anchors sit at
// the true ends of the track and the midpoint label at the true middle — and
// since the value is measured against that same track, they also sit at the
// true 0, 50 and 100 of the recorded scale.
//
// The pointer is hidden while this runs (`cursor-none`), so the handle is the
// participant's only feedback: it is drawn large, with a centre tick to make
// "neutral" findable without looking away from the video.
