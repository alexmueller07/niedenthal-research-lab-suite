// "There is more of this page below you."
//
// Ben, 2026-09-19: on the short-video task's partner page there is a fourth
// question under the fold, "and not everyone scrolled down every time and
// didn't see the last question". He suggested an arrow. He is right, and the
// problem is not limited to that page — every long questionnaire has the same
// shape, and the app now hides its scrollbar (App.css), which was the only
// thing telling anyone a page continued.
//
// So: one indicator, mounted against whichever element is doing the scrolling,
// visible only while there is genuinely something below, and gone the moment
// the participant reaches the bottom. It is deliberately not a button — the
// page is scrolled with the wheel, and an indicator that also scrolls for you
// invites clicking it repeatedly instead of reading. (It does scroll on click
// anyway, because a participant who taps an arrow expects *something*.)
//
// Why a poll rather than an IntersectionObserver sentinel: the content of these
// pages changes height as questions are answered (a race of radio buttons does
// not, but an "Other — please specify" field does), and a 300 ms poll on one
// element is cheaper than reasoning about which mutations need a re-measure.
// Nothing on this page is a measurement, so a frame of lag costs nothing.
