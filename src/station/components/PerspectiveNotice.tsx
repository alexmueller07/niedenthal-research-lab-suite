// The screen that tells a participant whose feelings the next thing is about.
//
// One component, two tasks. The continuous-slider task announces a perspective
// before every block; the video task announces one before every rating page.
// Randy asked (2026-08-05) for "the same waiting thing" in both, which is worth
// taking literally: the point of the screen is that a participant recognises it
// instantly and reads it, and two announcements that look slightly different
// are two announcements to learn.
//
// The dwell is a data-quality control, not decoration. A block rated from the
// wrong perspective is unusable and there is no way to detect it afterwards, so
// nothing advances until the countdown expires — and the remaining seconds are
// on screen, so the wait reads as deliberate rather than as a frozen app.
//
// Alex, 2026-09-19: once the dwell is over, a click anywhere works as well as a
// key, and there is a real Continue button. Ben's list had this screen in both
// of its "press any key" complaints — no button to click, and no way through
// for somebody whose hand is on the mouse. The dwell is unchanged; what changed
// is only how you get past it afterwards.
